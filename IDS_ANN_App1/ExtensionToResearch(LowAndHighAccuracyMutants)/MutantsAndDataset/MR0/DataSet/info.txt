===================Train data:using top 100 test instances============================
detailedDataSet.xls file contains data about the the mutants in 'ExtensionToResearch2' folder.

Original: First 50 iterations data from source (Source_1To25.xls,and Source_26To60Iterations.xls) and first 50 iterations data from follow-up (MR0_1To25.xlsx, and MR_26To60.xlsx) : in total we have 10,000 instances for mutant free/original program.
