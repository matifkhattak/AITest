Original/Mutant free: First 20 iterations data from source and first 20 iterations data from follow-up, total: 4000 instances 
Mutant1: First 10 iterations data from source and first 10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances
Mutant2:First 10 iterations data from source and first 10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances

Total: 8000 instances


Small change b=0.3 is done for MR0, thus giving the same accuracy as that of original
