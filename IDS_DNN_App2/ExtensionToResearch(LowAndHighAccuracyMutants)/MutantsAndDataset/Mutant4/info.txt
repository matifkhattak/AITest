=====Mutant4=====
=====data.py=====

It is valid mutant for ResearchpaperDNN3.py but not reachable in IDS_OpenStack.py because normalization step is not included in  IDS_OpenStack.py project.
It is inside data.py (trainX = scaler.transform(X), go to definition of transform(X))     
 X /= norms[:, np.newaxis]


To

 X *= norms[:, np.newaxis]
