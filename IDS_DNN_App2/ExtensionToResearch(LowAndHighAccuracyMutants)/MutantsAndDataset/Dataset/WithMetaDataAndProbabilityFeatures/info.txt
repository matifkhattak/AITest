Original: First 50 iterations data from source (Source_1To10Iterations.xls,and Source_11To25Iterations.xls,and Source_26To60Iterations.xls) and first 50 iterations data from follow-up (Followup_1To10Iterations.xlsx, Followup_11To25Iterations.xlsx, and Followup_26To60Iterations.xlsx) : 10,000 instances 
Mutant1: First 16 iterations data from source and first 13 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances
Mutant2:First 10 iterations data from source and first 10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances
Mutant3:First 10 iterations data from source and first 10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances
Mutant4:First 10 iterations data from source and first 10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances
Mutant5:First 10  iterations data from source and first10 iterations data from follow-up : 2000 instances

Total: 20,000 instances


Small change b=0.3 is done for MR0, thus giving the same accuracy as that of original
